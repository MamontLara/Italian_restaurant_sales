Google Colab: Data processing and visualization.

BigQuery: SQL queries for efficient data retrieval and analysis.

Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn for advanced data manipulation and visualization.


**Key Insights:**


The analysis examined monthly revenue dynamics, customer behavior across different types (e.g., Dine-In, Takeaway), and variations in payment methods, identifying key patterns and trends. Main courses, especially Fettuccine Alfredo, were found to dominate revenue, while desserts underperformed.


**Proposed Improvements:**


By leveraging seasonal data and customer preferences, the restaurant could build strategies that optimize its menu, introduce combo deals, and launch targeted promotions. These data-driven strategies could enhance customer satisfaction, drive higher revenue, and improve overall menu performance, tailored to the restaurant's peak periods and customer demands.
